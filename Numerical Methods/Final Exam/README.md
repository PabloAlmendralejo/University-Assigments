## Overview
This project implements various numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs), including:
* Euler's method (explicit and implicit)
* Heun's method
* Runge-Kutta methods
* Adams-Bashforth-Moulton methods

These methods provide different levels of accuracy and stability for solving ODEs.

## Prerequisites
To run the provided Python scripts, ensure you have the following installed:
* Python 3.x
* NumPy (for numerical computations)
* SciPy (for additional mathematical functions)
* Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
* SageMath (if using symbolic computation capabilities)

## Methods Implemented

### 1. Euler's Method
* **Explicit Euler**: Simple first-order method.
* **Implicit Euler**: Solves equations implicitly for stability in stiff problems.

### 2. Heun's Method
* A second-order Runge-Kutta method that improves accuracy over Euler's method.

### 3. Runge-Kutta Methods
* **RK4**: A fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for high accuracy.

### 4. Adams-Bashforth-Moulton Methods
* A multi-step predictor-corrector method for solving ODEs efficiently.
