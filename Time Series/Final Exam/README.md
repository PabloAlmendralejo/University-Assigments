# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting in R

This repository provides R code for performing time series analysis, focusing on methods such as decomposition, smoothing, and forecasting. It includes techniques like kMA (moving average), LOESS, STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS), and automatic decomposition for trend and seasonality. Additionally, it covers smoothing methods like Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), Holtâ€™s Linear Trend, and Holt-Winters with multiplicative or additive seasonality. The repository also implements AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA models for time series forecasting, alongside model simulations and error estimation. Code examples and visualizations of theoretical and sample autocorrelation functions (ACF) and partial autocorrelation functions (PACF) are included for in-depth analysis.
