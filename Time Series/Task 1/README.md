# Time Series Analysis of Tourism Revenue
This repository contains R scripts for performing time series analysis on monthly tourism revenue data from 1990 onward. The analysis includes multiple methods for decomposing the time series, such as multiplicative decomposition, Loess smoothing, and STL decomposition, to identify trend, seasonal, and residual components. The repository also demonstrates the application of moving averages (3-month, 7-month, and 2x12-month) for trend smoothing. Visualizations are generated to compare these methods and display the seasonal indices calculated from the decompositions. Users can replicate the analysis by loading the provided dataset, running the script, and interpreting the generated plots and results for trend modeling and seasonal pattern identification.
