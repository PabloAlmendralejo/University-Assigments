# Time Series Forecasting and Smoothing Techniques for Tourism Revenue Data
This repository contains R scripts for time series forecasting and smoothing using various methods, focusing on tourism revenue data starting from 1990. The script demonstrates the application of exponential smoothing techniques, such as Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt's Linear Trend method, Holt-Winters Additive and Multiplicative methods. The data is smoothed to capture trends and seasonal variations, followed by predictions for future values (up to 24 periods ahead). The accuracy of each model is assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE). Additionally, the repository includes visualizations comparing actual data with the predictions made by the various smoothing methods. Users can replicate the analysis by loading the provided dataset and interpreting the models' performance.
