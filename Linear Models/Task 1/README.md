# Estimation and Analysis in Linear Models with Full Rank

This project focuses on linear models with full rank, exploring the estimation of parameters in linear systems. It covers deriving unbiased estimators, determining conditions for uncorrelated estimators, and calculating their variances. The task includes using properties of matrices and covariance to derive formulas for estimators in models with multiple predictors, applying least squares estimation. Additionally, the project examines the estimation of linear combinations of parameters, the derivation of confidence intervals, and conditions for minimum variance estimators, demonstrating how they provide optimal accuracy under specific conditions, all grounded in linear algebra and statistical theory.
